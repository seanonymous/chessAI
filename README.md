This is a chess AI made using the minimax algorithm. The only outside resource used was John Zelle's graphics library for Python (Found here: http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py). 

To have actual pictures work as the pieces, download images from (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Chess_images) and put them in a folder names "/pieces" and name them "wpawn.png" "wrook.png" "wknight.png" "wbishop.png" "wqueen.png" "wking.png" and the same for black pieces, but with a "b" instead of a "w"
